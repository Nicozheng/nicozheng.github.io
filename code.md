Here you can find some of the programs I've written.

### Research

* [**The Roles Bots Play in Wikipedia**](https://github.com/Nicozheng/Wikipedia_bots_taxonomy)<br>
Data and Analysis code for our CSCW 2019 paper. It does feature engineering and builds a multi-class machine learning model to classify all registered bots in Wikipedia.


### Side Projects

* [**Google Scholar Crawler**](https://github.com/Nicozheng/GoogleScholarCrawler)<br>
This is a short python program that search, format, and download papers (if there is a public accessible one) form google scholar.

* [**Twitter Crawler**](https://github.com/Nicozheng/twitter_crawler)<br>
This is a short python code to search and download user's twittes and replies. I also recorded the hierarchical information for network research purpose.

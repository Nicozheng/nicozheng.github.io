I",<p>Hi! This is Nico Zheng (a.k.a Lei Zheng). Influenced by an <a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-you-really-any-good-at-threes/">article</a>, I decided to become a Data Scientist in 2014. After two years data mining work in Shanghai, I came to the US to keep further study. Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=672" target="_blank">Prof. Jeffrey V. Nickerson</a> and <a href="http://fengmai.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Feng Mai</a>. My research interests are Applied Machine Learning, Collective Intelligence, Natural Language Processing/Generation, and Social Network Analysis motivated by a broader range of real-world problems.</p>
<p>As a typical INTJ, I like to play with new techs and programming in my daily life. My favorite language is python. I love github, jupyter and markdown, don't like write <code>\textbf{}</code> and <code>public new class{}</code>, fall asleep when I see 40 pages paper.</p>

<p>Do you know that over 10% of the edits on Wikipedia are made by bots? These Wikipedia bots run various automated tasks such as fixing invalid links, fixing typos, and countering vandalism; they may also interact with users by reverting their edits and cleaning up user talk page; or they may occasionally “fight” with each other. Bots are extensively used in online communities such as Discord, Github, Slack, and Facebook. The Wikipedia community has a long history of using bots to assist collective knowledge production. The first Wikipedia bot appeared in October 2002 to add and maintain U.S. county and city articles. In Wikidata, the Wikipedia community's document database, the proportion of edits made by bots has reached 88%. Clearly, bots are an essential force in the process of knowledge creation and maintenance.</p>

<p>Bots are tools, but they are different in nature because of their autonomy. Once deployed, bots quickly amplify human effort in both speed and scale. For example, ClueBot NG, the community's anti-vandal bot, makes thousands of edits every day and can revert a malicious edit within 30 seconds of that edit being made. This significantly reduces the community's time-to-revert and protects articles from vandalistic edits. However, as shown in previous studies, these automatic tools designed for quality control have inadvertently decreased the newcomers' retention rate because edits from newcomers are considered immature and therefore are more likely to be reverted. As the use of bots becomes more prevalent, their effects will warrant further study.</p>

<p>For a new study that will be published in CSCW in this November, we propose a nine-category taxonomy of bots based on their functions in English Wikipedia. We then build a multi-class classifier to classify 1,601 bots based on their descriptions and editing behavior. We study the activities of the bots with different roles: their edit frequency, their working spaces, and the evolution of their roles. We further investigate the effect of interacting with various bots on newcomers' retention rate. We find that bots, even for bots within the same role category, could have different effects on newcomers’ retention. Based on this within categories comparison, we infer a better bot governance framework in online communities.</p>

<h3 id="the-roles-of-bots">The Roles of bots</h3>
<p>We identify nine roles along with their associated bot functions using a combination of network analysis and text mining. Following picture shows a bot functions network, in which functions within the same role category are marked as the same color. Other than the well-known functions such as counter-vandalism and article generation, we find other distinct bot functions and roles: for example, a Fixer bot fixes links, content or files in the article pages; the Clerk bot calculates and update statistical information, document user status, and update maintenance pages; the Advisor bot greet the newcomers and provide personalized suggestions for how they can contribute. We find bots with different roles also edit different areas in Wikipedia. The Fixer, Generator, and Connector bots mainly take care of article content pages, while the Tagger, Clerk, and Archiver maintain both the content pages and the community pages. The Advisor, Protector, and Notifier are more user-oriented when compared to their peers.</p>

<h3 id="the-evolution-of-bot-roles">The Evolution of Bot Roles</h3>
<p>We then look at how the bot system in Wikipedia has evolved. The following picture shows the number of active bots and bot edits by role from January 2003 to December 2018. We find that both the number of active bots and the number of bot edits increased between 2003 and 2013. The sharp decline in 2013 is likely caused by a community consensus to move the old style of inter-language linkages (links that refer to the same article in different language versions of Wikipedia) over to Wikidata. Therefore, dozens of Connector bots that were created to maintain inter-language links decreased their edits and became inactive. After 2013, the number of active bots decreased slowly but the number of bot edits soon climbed back up. This pattern suggests bots are being consolidated in the English Wikipedia. This consolidation could happen both within and across role categories. Within-category consolidation happens when superior or broader-scope bots take over the jobs performed by weaker or narrower-scope ones. For example, over 50% of Protector bots slowly become inactive after the launch of ClueBot NG in 2011. The bot (ClueBot NG) is so fast and productive that it leaves less work for the others that perform similar functions. Cross-category consolidation happens when 1) the bot owners decide to make their bots handle multiple functions; 2) bots took over tasks that originally performed by some inactive bots.</p>

<h3 id="roles-and-the-survival-rates-of-wikipedia-newcomers">Roles and the Survival Rates of Wikipedia Newcomers</h3>
<p>Finally, we look at the consequences of bot-human interactions. Specifically, we look at how bots serve different roles affect the retention rate of 10,000 randomly sampled newcomers. We find the interaction with Advisor bots having a significant positive effect, whereas the interaction with Protector bots having a significant negative effect. Moreover, we find bots within the same role category could have different effects on newcomers. For example, there are two Advisor bots that interacted with the newcomers in our sample. HostBot interacts with more editors than SuggestBot, whereas the latter has a larger positive effect than the former. Surprisingly, among the three Protector bots, only the ClueBot NG has a significant negative effect. The newcomers seem to not care about the bot signing their comments (SineBot) and even positively influenced by the bot reverting their added links that violate Wikipedia's copyright policy (XLinkBot). Different reactions to these Protector bots may be caused by different verbal traits in the messages left by the bots. Comparing with ClueBot NG, XLinkBot's messages are longer, more friendly, and more informative. In general, this kind of within-category comparison allows the community to build a better bot governance system to evaluate individual bot’s impact (the number of audiences) as well as their effect (influence towards a specific question, in this case, newcomers’ survival). Bot owners could learn from good examples while the community could identify bots that are likely to have extremely negative effects.</p>

<h3 id="some-final-notes">Some Final Notes</h3>
<p>Bots are playing an increasingly important role in online communities. Together, humans and bots form an ecosystem, in which they adapt to and learn from each other. Humans develop bots, argue for their approval, and maintain them. They also monitor bots activities, merge similar bots, split complex bots, and turn off malfunctioning bots. Our work is the first step toward understanding the functions and functional categories of bots. The derived taxonomy can be used to study other types of work such as how bots affect human works, how their functionality evolved over time, and how to build a better bot governance system. To inspire future research (and potential collaborations), we open-sourced our code to analyze the bots.</p>

I"É<p>Hi! This is Nico Zheng (a.k.a Lei Zheng). Influenced by an <a href="https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/are-you-really-any-good-at-threes/">article</a>, I decided to become a Data Scientist in 2014. After two years data mining work in Shanghai, I came to the US to keep further study. Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. Student at <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://web.stevens.edu/facultyprofile/?id=672" target="_blank">Prof. Jeffrey V. Nickerson</a> and <a href="http://fengmai.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Feng Mai</a>. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>My research interests are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Applied Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing/Generation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis">Social Network Analysis</a> motivated by a broader range of real-world problems. I published in both the Information Systems and the CHI communities.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a typical <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ</a> type, I like to play with new techs and programming in my daily life. My favorite language is python. I love github, jupyter and markdown. I don't like <code>std::string name="xyz"</code> and <code>public new class{}</code>. I fall asleep when I see a 40 pages paper.</p>
